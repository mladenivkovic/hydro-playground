\hydro is a simple toy code solving finite volume hydrodynamics in 1D and 2D.
The main goal is to have simple working code as a playground for developments
in terms of acceleration, optimisation, and parallelisation.

It is based on the \codename{Mesh-Hydro}
code\footnote{https://github.com/mladenivkovic/mesh-hydro}, which is a
playground to learn about and experiment with numerical methods to solve
hyperbolic conservation laws, in particular the advection equation and the
Euler equations of ideal gases.
