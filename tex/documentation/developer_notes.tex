\subsection{Adding New Files}
%===============================================================================

I've chosen to go with a simple principle of creating a library for any pair of
\verb|.cpp| and \verb|.h| files. To add them to the \verb|cmake| build system,
modify the file \verb|src/CMakeLists.txt|.


For example, let's first look at the ``\verb|Logging|'' library. We have a file
\verb|Logging.cpp| and \verb|Logging.h|. In \verb|src/CMakeLists.txt|, we add
the library as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
add_library(Logging Logging.cpp Logging.h)
\end{lstlisting}

The library's name in \verb|cmake|'s internal registry is then called
\verb|Logging|.

Our main executable, which has the name \verb|hydro| in \verb|cmake|'s
internals, will need to have the \verb|Logging| library linked against it. So
we need to tell \verb|cmake| about that:

\begin{lstlisting}
target_link_libraries(hydro Logging)
\end{lstlisting}

And that should do the trick!


Note however that other libraries may require other libraries too. For example,
the \verb|Utils| library, defined in \verb|src/CMakeLists.txt| as

\begin{lstlisting}
add_library(Utils Utils.cpp Utils.h)
\end{lstlisting}

also needs the \verb|Version| and the \verb|Logging| library linked against it.
We then simply need to add the dependency using the same syntax as for the
executable \verb|hydro| above, and just change the target:

\begin{lstlisting}
target_link_libraries(Utils Version)
target_link_libraries(Utils Logging)
\end{lstlisting}
