\subsection{Adding New Files}
%===============================================================================

I've chosen to go with a simple principle of creating a library for any pair of
\verb|.cpp| and \verb|.h| files. To add them to the \verb|cmake| build system,
modify the file \verb|src/CMakeLists.txt|.


For example, let's first look at the ``\verb|Logging|'' library. We have a file
\verb|Logging.cpp| and \verb|Logging.h|. In \verb|src/CMakeLists.txt|, we add
the library as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
add_library(Logging Logging.cpp Logging.h)
\end{lstlisting}

The library's name in \verb|cmake|'s internal registry is then called
\verb|Logging|.

Our main executable, which has the name \verb|hydro| in \verb|cmake|'s
internals, will need to have the \verb|Logging| library linked against it. So
we need to tell \verb|cmake| about that:

\begin{lstlisting}
target_link_libraries(hydro Logging)
\end{lstlisting}

And that should do the trick!




% -----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Libraries with other dependencies}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------

Note however that other libraries may require other libraries too. For example,
the \verb|Utils| library, defined in \verb|src/CMakeLists.txt| as

\begin{lstlisting}
add_library(Utils Utils.cpp Utils.h)
\end{lstlisting}

also needs the \verb|Version| and the \verb|Logging| library linked against it.
We then simply need to add the dependency using the same syntax as for the
executable \verb|hydro| above, and just change the target:

\begin{lstlisting}
target_link_libraries(Utils Version)
target_link_libraries(Utils Logging)
\end{lstlisting}





% -----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{\texttt{Version.cpp} and \texttt{Config.h}}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, there are two exceptions to this procedure. Those are the files
\verb|Version.cpp| and \verb|Config.h|. They are special because they will be
generated with \verb|cmake| from their respective templates,
\verb|src/Config.h.in| and \verb|src/Version.cpp.in|.

The generated files will be \verb|your_build_dir/Version.cpp| and
\verb|your_build_dir/Config.h|.  So to get the \verb|Version| library to
compile, we need to tell it a) where to find the file, and b) that the header
file that needs to be included is in a different directory. We do that as
follows:


\begin{lstlisting}
add_library(Version "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/Version.cpp" Version.h)
target_include_directories(Version PUBLIC "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}")
\end{lstlisting}

\verb|${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}| is the directory you're currently building the
project in. The \verb|${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}| variable gives you the path
to the directory where the \verb|CMakeLists.txt| file is located, which is
conveniently the same directory as the \verb|Version.h| header file.



Similarly, if you want a library to include the \verb|Config.h| header, you need to tell it where it is as follows. Take for example the library \verb|Utils| again:

\begin{lstlisting}
add_library(Utils Utils.cpp Utils.h)
target_include_directories(Utils PUBLIC "${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}")
\end{lstlisting}
