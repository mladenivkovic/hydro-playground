\subsection{The Riemann Problem and Solution Strategy}
%====================================================================



At the heart of Eulerian (not-comoving) numerical fluid dynamics is the
solution to a specific initial value problem (IVP) called the ``Riemann
problem''. For a hyperbolic system of conservation laws of the form

\begin{align}
	\DELDT{\U} + \DELDX{\F(\U))} = 0
\end{align}

the Riemann problem is defined as

\begin{align}
	\U(x, t=0) = 
		\begin{cases}
			\U_L & \text{ if } x < 0\\
			\U_R & \text{ if } x > 0\\
		\end{cases}
\end{align}

see also Fig.~\ref{fig:riemann-problem}.

	\caption{
		The Riemann Initial Value Problem in 1D.
		\label{fig:riemann-problem}
	}
\end{figure}





Unfortunately, there is no exact closed-form solution to the Riemann problem
for the Euler equations. However, it is possible to devise iterative schemes
whereby the solution can be computed numerically
(Section~\ref{chap:riemann-exact}). To solve full fluid dynamics problems, this
calculation needs to be repeated many many times, making the solution quite
expensive. For that reason, people have developed approximate Riemann solvers,
which we also will have a look at (Section~\ref{chap:riemann-approximate}).



For a full derivation of how to solve the Riemann problem for the Euler
equations, see e.g. \cite{toro}. For our purposes, it suffices to accept that
(assuming we have no vacuum) as time progresses, three waves will form which
will separate the two initial states $\U_L$ and $\U_R$.
This results in two new states, $\U_L^*$ and $\U_R^*$ between the initial
states, because  $\U_L^*$ and $\U_R^*$ themselves will be separated by a wave.
This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:riemann-solution}.


\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics{./figures/riemann_solution.pdf}%

(1), (2), and (3), arise from the origin as time evolves. (2) is always a
contact wave, (1) and (3) can be either rarefaction or shock waves in each
case, depending on the initial conditions.\\
The initial states $\U_L$ and $\U_R$ are separated through the waves (1) and
(3) from the two new arising ``star states'' $\U_L^*$ and $\U_R^*$, which

%===========================================
\subsection{Wave Types and Relations}
%===========================================





It turns out that we get three types of waves: A contact wave, a shock wave,
and a rarefaction wave. The middle wave is always a contact wave. The left and
right waves can be any combination of shock and/or rarefaction wave, depending
on the initial conditions. A model problem containing all three waves is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:riemann-solved}. These are the wave properties:






%===========================================
\subsubsection{Contact Wave}
%===========================================

The contact wave is a jump discontinuity in the density $\rho$ only.
Pressure and velocity remain constant across the contact wave.
This gives us the relations


\begin{align*}
	p^*_L &= p^*_R = p^*\\
	v^*_L &= v^*_R = v^*\\
\end{align*}

For this reason, the star state pressure and velocity will have no index
indicating whether they are the left or right star state, and will be referred
to as $p^*$ and $v^*$, respectively.









%===========================================
\subsubsection{Shock Wave}
%===========================================

All three primitive variables $\rho$, $p$, and $v$ change across a shock wave.
A shock wave is a jump discontinuity too. If the \textbf{leftmost} wave (wave
(1) in Fig. \ref{fig:riemann-solution}) is a shock wave, we have

\begin{align*}
\rho^*_L &=
	\frac{\frac{p^*}{p_L} + \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma+1}}
	{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma+1} \frac{p^*}{p_L} + 1}
	\rho_L \\
v^* &=
	v_L - \frac{p^* - p_L}{\sqrt{\frac{p^* + B_L}{A_L}}}\\
	& = v_L - f_L(p^*) \\
A_L &=
	\frac{2}{(\gamma + 1) \rho_L}\\
B_L &=
	\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1} p_L
\end{align*}

$f_{L}$ is given in eq. \ref{eq:riemann-pstar}, and the shock speed is
\begin{align*}
S_L = v_L - a_L \left[\frac{\gamma + 1}{2 \gamma} \frac{p^*}{p_L} +
	\frac{\gamma - 1}{2\gamma} \right]^{\half}
\end{align*}

where $a_L$ is the sound speed (Eq.~\ref{eq:soundspeed}) in the left state
$\U_L$.



For a \textbf{right shock wave}, i.e. when wave (3) is a shock wave, we have
the relations


\begin{align*}
\rho^*_R &=
	\frac{\frac{p^*}{p_R} + \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma+1}}
		{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma+1} \frac{p^*}{p_R} + 1}
	\rho_R \\
v^* &=
	v_R + \frac{p^* - p_R}{\sqrt{\frac{p^* + B_R}{A_R}}}\\
	& = v_R + f_R(p^*) \\
A_R &=
	\frac{2}{(\gamma + 1) \rho_R}\\
B_R &=
	\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1} p_R
\end{align*}

and the shock speed is
\begin{align*}
S_R = v_R + a_R \left[\frac{\gamma + 1}{2 \gamma} \frac{p^*}{p_R} +
	\frac{\gamma - 1}{2\gamma} \right]^{\half}
\end{align*}

where $a_R$ is the sound speed in the right state $\U_R$. $f_R$ is given in
equation \ref{eq:riemann-pstar}.








%===========================================
\subsubsection{Rarefaction Wave}
%===========================================

Rarefaction waves are smooth transitions, not infinitesimally thin jump
discontinuities like the contact wave and the shock wave. This makes them
really easy to spot in the solutions of Riemann problems, see e.g.
Fig.~\ref{fig:riemann-solved}. Across rarefactions, entropy is conserved.

The rarefaction waves are enclosed by the head and the tail of the wave,
between which we have a smooth transition which is called the ``fan''. The head
is the ``front'' of the wave, i.e. the part of the wave that gets furthest away
from the origin as time progresses. The tail is the ``back'' of the wave, i.e.
the part of the wave that stays closest to the origin as time progresses.
The wave speeds of the head, $S_H$, and of the tail, $S_T$, are both given
below.


If we have a \textbf{left-facing} rarefaction, i.e. if wave (1) is a rarefaction wave, we have

\begin{align*}
\rho^*_L &=
	\rho_L \left( \frac{p^*}{p_L} \right) ^ \frac{1}{\gamma}\\
v^* &=
	v_L - \frac{2 a_L}{\gamma - 1} \left[
		\left( \frac{p^*}{p_L} \right) ^ \frac{\gamma - 1}{2 \gamma} -1
	\right]\\
	& = v_L - f_L(p^*) \\
\end{align*}

$f_{L}$ is given in eq. \ref{eq:riemann-pstar}, and $a_L$ is the sound speed in
the left state $U_L$.


The wave speeds of the head, $S_H$, and the tail, $S_T$, for the left facing
wave are:

\begin{align*}
	S_{HL} &= v_L - a_L\\
	S_{TL} &= v^* - a^*_L\\
	a^*_L  &= a_L \left( \frac{p^*}{p_L} \right) ^ \frac{\gamma - 1}{2 \gamma}
\end{align*}


Finally, the solution inside the rarefaction fan, i.e. in regions where $S_{HL}
\leq \frac{x}{t} \leq S_{TL}$, is

\begin{align}
\rho_{\text{fan}, L} &=
	\rho_L \left[
		\frac{2}{\gamma + 1} +
		\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1}
		\frac{1}{a_L}
		\left(v_L - \frac{x}{t}\right)
	\right] ^ \frac{2}{\gamma -1 }
	\label{eq:rho-rarefaction-fan-left}\\
v_{\text{fan}, L} &=
	\frac{2}{\gamma + 1} \left[
		\frac{\gamma - 1}{2} v_L + a_L + \frac{x}{t}
	\right] \\
p_{\text{fan}, L} &=
	p_L \left[
		\frac{2}{\gamma + 1} +
		\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1}
		\frac{1}{a_L}
		\left(v_L - \frac{x}{t}\right)
	\right] ^ \frac{2 \gamma}{\gamma -1}
	\label{eq:pressure-rarefaction-fan-left}
\end{align}









If we have a \textbf{right-facing rarefaction}, i.e. if wave (3) is a
rarefaction wave, we have:

\begin{align*}
\rho^*_R &=
	\rho_R \left( \frac{p^*}{p_R} \right) ^ \frac{1}{\gamma}\\
v^* &=
	v_R - \frac{2 a_R}{\gamma - 1}
	\left[
		1 - \left( \frac{p^*}{p_R} \right) ^ \frac{\gamma - 1}{2 \gamma}
	\right]\\
	&= v_R + f_R(p^*)
\end{align*}

where $a_R$ is the sound speed in the left state $\U_R$.
$f_R$ is given in Equation~\ref{eq:riemann-pstar}.





The wave speeds of the head, $S_H$, and the tail, $S_T$, for the right facing
wave are:

\begin{align*}
	S_{HR} &= v_R + a_R\\
	S_{TR} &= v^* + a^*_R\\
	a^*_R  &= a_R \left( \frac{p^*}{p_R} \right) ^ \frac{\gamma - 1}{2 \gamma}
\end{align*}




Finally, the solution inside the rarefaction fan, i.e. in regions where $S_{HL}
\geq \frac{x}{t} \geq S_{TL}$, is:

\begin{align}
\rho_{\text{fan}, R} &=
	\rho_R \left[
		\frac{2}{\gamma + 1} -
		\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1}
		\frac{1}{a_R}
		\left(v_R - \frac{x}{t}\right)
	\right] ^ \frac{2}{\gamma -1 }
	\label{eq:rho-rarefaction-fan-right}\\
v_{\text{fan}, R} &=
	\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}
	\left[
		\frac{\gamma - 1}{2} v_R - a_R + \frac{x}{t}
	\right] \\
p_{\text{fan}, R} &=
	p_R
	\left[
		\frac{2}{\gamma + 1} -
		\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1}
		\frac{1}{a_R}
		\left(v_R - \frac{x}{t}\right)
	\right] ^ \frac{2 \gamma}{\gamma -1}
	\label{eq:pressure-rarefaction-fan-right}
\end{align}












%===========================================
\subsubsection{Which Wave Type Do We Have?}
%===========================================


As written before, the middle wave (wave (2) in Fig. \ref{fig:riemann-solution}
) is always a contact wave, while the other two waves are any combination of
rarefaction and/or shock wave. It turns out that the condition for a
rarefaction or shock wave is remarkably simple.

For the left wave (wave (1)):

\begin{align}
	p^* > p_L: && &\quad \text{ (1) is a shock wave}\\
	p^* \leq p_L: && &\quad \text{ (1) is a rarefaction wave}
\end{align}

and for the right wave (wave (3)):

\begin{align}
	p^* > p_R: && & \quad \text{ (3) is a shock wave} \\
	p^* \leq p_R: && & \quad \text{ (3) is a rarefaction wave} 
\end{align}










%===========================================
\subsubsection{Solution for $p^*$}
%===========================================

The only thing missing to have a complete solution to the Riemann problem for
the Euler equations is an expression how to obtain $p^*$, the pressure in the
star region, depending on the initial conditions $\U_L$ and $\U_R$. We make use
of the fact that $p^*$ and $v^*$ are constant across the star region to relate
$\U_L$ and $\U_R$, or more precisely the primitive states $\mathbf{W}_L$ and
$\mathbf{W}_R$ which can easily be derived from the conservative ones.
For both shock and rarefaction waves on either side, we have equations for
$v^*$ depending on the outer states  $\mathbf{W}_L$ and $\mathbf{W}_R$ and
$p^*$. By setting $v^*_L - v^*_R = 0$, which must hold, we get the equation:

\begin{align}
f(p, \mathbf{W}_L, \mathbf{W}_R)
	\equiv f_L(p, \mathbf{W}_L) + f_R(p, \mathbf{W}_R) + (v_R - v_L)
	= 0
\label{eq:riemann-pressure-equation}
\end{align}

with 

\begin{align}
f_{L,R} &=
	\begin{cases}
		(p - p_{L,R}) \left[ \frac{A_{L,R}}{p + B_{L,R}}
\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}
			& ~\text{ if } ~ p > p_{L,R} ~ \quad \text{(shock)} \\
		\frac{2 a_{L,R}}{\gamma - 1} \left[ \left( \frac{p}{p_{L,R}}
\right)^ \frac{\gamma -1}{2 \gamma} - 1 \right]
			& ~\text{ if } ~ p \leq p_{L,R} ~ \quad \text{(rarefaction)}
\label{eq:riemann-pstar}\\
	\end{cases} \\
A_{L,R} &=
	\frac{2}{(\gamma + 1) \rho_{L,R}}\\
B_{L,R} &=
	\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1} p_{L,R}
\end{align}

%====================================================================
\subsection{Exact Solver}\label{chap:riemann-exact}
%====================================================================


The equation for $p^*$, the pressure in the star region
(Eq.~\ref{eq:riemann-pstar}) can't be solved analytically, but it can be solved
iteratively. Since we have the analytic function and the first derivative
w.r.t. $p$ can be computed, i.e.

\begin{align*}
\frac{\del f_{L,R}}{\del p} &=
	\begin{cases}
		\left[
			\frac{A_{L,R}}{p + B_{L,R}}
		\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}
		\left(
			1 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{p - p_{L,R}}{p + B_{L,R}}
		\right)
	& ~\text{ if } ~ p > p_{L,R} ~ \quad \text{(shock)} \\
		\frac{a_{L,R}}{\gamma p_{L,R}}
		\left(
			\frac{p}{p_{L,R}}
		\right)^ \frac{-(\gamma+1)}{2 \gamma}
	& ~\text{ if } ~ p \leq p_{L,R} ~ \quad \text{(rarefaction)}
\label{eq:riemann-pstar-dp}\\
		\end{cases} \\
A_{L,R} &=
	\frac{2}{(\gamma + 1) \rho_{L,R}}\\
B_{L,R} &=
	\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1} p_{L,R}
\end{align*}


Then, using the Newton-Raphson iterative root finding method, we can find the
solution using the prescription:

\begin{align}
	p_{n+1} = p_n - \frac{f(p_n)}{\frac{\del f(p_n)}{\del p}}
\end{align}


We re-iterate until it converges, i.e. when the relative pressure change

\begin{align}
	\frac{|p_k - p_{k+1}|}{\frac{1}{2} | p_k + p_{k+1} | } < \epsilon
\end{align}

where $\epsilon$ is some tolerance.


However, we need to find a first guess for the pressure, $p_0$.
An okay way to do it is to take the average:

\begin{align*}
	p_0^* = \frac{1}{2} (p_L + p_R)
\end{align*}

The implemented way is based on a linearised solution based on the linearized
primitive variable Riemann solver:

\begin{align}
p_{PV} &=
	\frac{1}{2} (p_L + p_R) -
	\frac{1}{8} (v_R - v_L)(\rho_L + \rho_R)(a_L + a_R)\\
	p_0^* &= \max(\epsilon, p_{PV})
\label{eq:pPV}
\end{align}

% Note that every step along the iteration, we must make sure that we didn't
% accidentally get negative pressures, and limit it to zero (or the tolerance
% $\epsilon$). If it drops below zero, it might get stuck there, and then all
% hell breaks loose. (Seriously, you will get NANs because you're trying to take
% fractal powers of negative stuff.)


That concludes the equations relevant to the exact Riemann solver. All that is
left to do is sample the solution, which is described in
Section~\ref{chap:sampling-solution}.






%====================================================================
\subsection{Approximate Solvers}\label{chap:riemann-approximate}
%====================================================================


While an exact solver exists, as outlined above, it is often very expensive due
to the needed itative method to determine the star state pressure. So instead,
approximate Riemann solvers have been developed, which have been shown to
perform adequately. We outline some of them here.





%===============================================================================
\subsubsection{Two-Rarefaction Riemann Solver (TRRS)}\label{chap:riemann-trrs}
%===============================================================================




The big idea is to assume a priori that both the left and right waves are
going to be rarefaction waves, and to use that assumption to get an expression
for $p^*$ and $v^*$, the pressure and velocity in the star region, respectively.

We get

\begin{align}
\beta &\equiv
	\frac{\gamma - 1}{2 \gamma} \\
v^* &=
	\frac{
		\frac{2}{\gamma - 1}
		\left[
			\left(\frac{p_L}{p_R} \right) ^ \beta - 1
		\right] +
		\frac{v_L}{a_L}
		\left(
			\frac{p_L}{p_R}
		\right) ^ \beta  + \frac{v_R}{a_R}
	}{
		\frac{1}{a_R} +
		\frac{1}{a_L}\left(\frac{p_L}{p_R} \right) ^ \beta
	} \\
p^* &=
	\frac{1}{2}
	\left[
		p_R
		\left[
			\frac{\gamma - 1}{2 a_R} (v^* - v_R) + 1
		\right] ^ \frac{1}{\beta} + p_L
		\left[
			\frac{\gamma - 1}{2 a_L} (v_L - v^*) + 1
		\right] ^ \frac{1}{\beta}
	\right] \label{eq:pstar-trrs}
\end{align}

Note that we may also write $p^*$ independently of $v^*$:

\begin{align}
p^* =
	\left[
		\frac{
			a_L + a_R - \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} (v_R - v_L)
		}{
			\frac{a_L}{p_L^\beta} +		\frac{a_R}{p_R^\beta}
		}
	\right] ^ \frac{1}{\beta}
\end{align}

But Eq.~\ref{eq:pstar-trrs} is computationally more efficient if we compute
$v^*$ first. (Way fewer uses of fractional powers.)















% %=============================================================================
\subsubsection{Two-Shock Riemann Solver (TSRS)}\label{chap:riemann-tsrs}
% %=============================================================================


The big idea is to assume a priori that both the left and right waves are
going to be shock waves, and to use that assumption to get an expression for
$p^*$ and $v^*$, the pressure and velocity in the star region, respectively.


The equation for the pressure in the star region (eq.
\ref{eq:riemann-pressure-equation}) then is given by

\begin{align}
f(p) &=
	(p - p_L) g_L(p) + (p - p_R) g_R(p) + v_R - v_L = 0
	\label{eq:riemann-pressure-tsrs} \\
%
g_{L,R}(p) &=
	\left[
		\frac{A_{L,R}}{p + B_{L,R}}
	\right] ^{\half} \\
%
A_{L,R} &=
	\frac{2}{(\gamma + 1) \rho_{L,R}}\\
B_{L,R} &=
	\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1} p_{L,R}
\end{align}

Unfortunately, this approximation does not lead to a closed form solution. So
we can either use an iterative method again, or use further approximations.
Then the idea is to find $p_0$, an estimate for the pressure to use in
Eq.~\ref{eq:riemann-pressure-tsrs}, and to use that to get a better
approximation for $p^*$:

\begin{align}
p^* =
	\frac{
		g_L(p_0) p_L + g_R(p_0)p_R - (v_R - v_L)
	}{
		g_L(p_0) + g_R(p_0)
	}
	\label{eq:pstar-tsrs}
\end{align}

and

\begin{align}
v^*  =
	\frac{1}{2} (v_L + v_R) +
	\frac{1}{2}
	\left[
		(p^* - p_R) g_R(p_0) - (p^* - p_L) g_L(p_0)
	\right]
\end{align}


A good choice for $p_0$ is coming from the solution of the linearised
primitive variables approach (Eq.~\ref{eq:pPV}).











%====================================================================
\subsubsection{HLLC Solver}\label{chap:riemann-hllc}
%====================================================================


The HLLC solver is based on the approximation that we have 3 waves which are
jump discontinuities, travelling with the speeds $S_L$, $S^*$, and $S_R$,
respectively. Using integral relations and Rankine-Hugeniot relations, we
directly find an expression for the fluxes $\F$:


\begin{align}
\F_{i+\half} = \begin{cases}
	\F_L ~~~~ &\text{ if }		~~	\frac{x}{t} \leq S_L \\
	\F^*_L ~~~~ &\text{ if }	~~  S_L \leq \frac{x}{t} \leq S^* \\
	\F^*_R ~~~~ &\text{ if }	~~	S^* \leq \frac{x}{t} \leq S_R \\
	\F_R ~~~~ &\text{ if }		~~	S_R \leq \frac{x}{t} \\
\end{cases}
\end{align}

where $x/t = 0$ at the boundary of a cell, $i+\half$, and with

\begin{align}
S^* &=
	\frac{
		p_R - p_L  + \rho_L v_L (S_L - v_L) - \rho_R v_R (S_R - v_R)
	} {
		\rho_L (S_L - v_L) - \rho_R (S_R - v_R)
	}
	\label{eq:hllc-sstar}\\[.5em]
%
\U^*_{L,R} &=
	\rho_{L,R} \frac{ S_{L,R} - v_{x;L,R}}{S_{L,R} - S^*}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		1\\
		S^*\\
		v_{x;L,R}\\
		v_{y;L,R}\\
		\frac{E_{L,R}}{\rho_{L,R}} +
		(S^* - v_{x;L,R})
		\left(
			S^* + \frac{p_{L,R}}{\rho_{L,R}(S_{L,R} - v_{x;L,R})}
		\right)
	\end{pmatrix} \\[.5em]
%
\F^*_{L,R} &=
	\F_{L, R} + S_{L,R} ( \U^*_{L,R} - \U_{L,R} )
\end{align}

for the flux in $x$ - direction. $v_{x;L,R}$ denotes the velocity component in
$x$-direction of the (L)eft and (R)ight state, respectievly. For $y$ and $z$
directions, you'll just need to exchange the velocity components in $S^*$
appropriately. $\U_{L,R}$ are the given initial states, and $\F_{L,R} =
\F(\U_{L,R})$ the corresponding initial states.



What we still lack is estimates for the left and right wave speeds, $S_L$ and
$S_R$. There are multiple ways to get good and robust estimates. A very simple,
implemented one is:

\begin{align}
S_L  &= v_L - a_L q_L \\
S_R  &= v_R + a_R q_R \\
q_{L,R} &=
	\begin{cases}
		1	~~~~ &
			\text{ if } p^* \leq p_{L,R} ~~~~ \text{(rarefaction)}\\
		\sqrt{1 + \frac{\gamma + 1}{2 \gamma}
		\left(\frac{p^*}{p_{L,R}} - 1 \right)}	~~~~ &
		\text{ if } p^* > p_{L,R} ~~~~ \text{(shock)}\\
	\end{cases} \\
p^* &= \max(0, p_{PV})\\
p_{PV} &=
	\frac{1}{2} (p_L + p_R) -
	\frac{1}{8} (v_R - v_L)(\rho_L + \rho_R)(a_L + a_R)
	\label{eq:pstar-pv}.
\end{align}



You can get a better estimate using an adaptive wave speed estimate method.
We also start off by computing the primitive variable solution for the star
state pressure $p^*$ following Eq.~\ref{eq:pstar-pv}.
Then we assume that the primitive variable estimate is ok as long as:
%
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The ratio $\frac{p_{max}}{p_{min}}$ is small enough, where
	$p_{max} = \max \{ p_L, p_R \}$ and
	$p_{min} = \min \{ p_L, p_R \}$.
	(In the code, the threshold ratio is hardcoded as $2$.)
\item $p_{min} \leq p_{PV} \leq p_{max}$
\end{itemize}
%
%
If that is not the case, then we switch to the star state solutions of other
approximate Riemann solvers: If $p_{PV} \leq p_{min}$, then we will certainly
expect two rarefactions to form, so we use the star state estimates of the Two
Rarefaction Riemann Solver (TRRS, eq. \ref{eq:pstar-trrs}).
Otherwise, we have at least one shock, so use the star state estimates of the
Two Shock Riemann Solver (TSRS, eq. \ref{eq:pstar-tsrs}).


% The adaptive wave speed estimate is used by default in the code, but can be
% turned off by removing the line \verb|#define HLLC_USE_ADAPTIVE_SPEED_ESTIMATE|
% from \texttt{defines.h}.


Note that we don't need to compute the contact wave speed $S^*$ according to
Eq.~\ref{eq:hllc-sstar} in case we are using the TSRS or TRRS estimates, since
this equation follows from the Rankine-Hugeniot relations of three infinitely
thin waves. Instead, you can directly compute it using the approximation that
you are employing at that moment.

\subsection{Dealing with Vacuum}
%====================================================================


Vacuum is characterized by the condition $\rho = 0$. With the equation of
state, we also have $p = 0$ and $E = 0$ following from $\rho = 0$.

The structure of the solution to the Riemann problem is different, there is no
more star region. It can be shown that a shock wave can't be adjacent to a
vacuum. Instead, we have a rarefaction wave and a contact wave which coalesces
with the tail of the rarefaction. So we have a jump discontinuity next to the
vacuum, which makes perfect sense, and this discontinuity will travel with some
``escape velocity'' $v_{vac}$.
Hence it makes sense to characterize the vacuum state as
$\mathbf{W}_{vac} = (0, v_0, 0)$.

There are three cases to consider:


\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{The right state is a vacuum:}

	The vacuum front travels with the velocity
	%
	\begin{equation}
		S_{vac, L} = v_L + \frac{2 a_L}{\gamma - 1}
	\end{equation}
	%
	and left of it we have a left going rarefaction wave, i.e.
	%
	\begin{align}
		\mathbf{W}_{L, \text{ with vacuum }} =
			\begin{cases}
			\mathbf{W_L} &
				\quad \text{ if } \frac{x}{t} \leq v_L - a_L \\
			\mathbf{W_{L, \text{inside fan}}} &
				\quad \text{ if }
					v_L - a_L < \frac{x}{t} < S_{\mathrm{vac}, L} \\
			\mathbf{W_{vac}} &
				\quad \text{ if } \frac{x}{t} \geq S_{\mathrm{vac}, L}\\
			\end{cases}
	\end{align}

\item \textbf{The left state is a vacuum:}
	
		The vacuum front travels with the velocity
		%
		\begin{equation}
			S_{\mathrm{vac}, R} = v_R - \frac{2 a_R}{\gamma - 1}
		\end{equation}
		%
		and right of it we have a right going rarefaction wave, i.e.
		%
		\begin{align}
		\mathbf{W}_{R, \text{ with vacuum }} =
			\begin{cases}
			\mathbf{W_{vac}} &
				\quad \text{ if } \frac{x}{t} \leq S_{\mathrm{vac}, R}\\
			\mathbf{W_{R, \text{inside fan}}} &
				\quad \text{ if }
					S_{\mathrm{vac}, R} < \frac{x}{t} < v_R + a_R\\
			\mathbf{W_R} &
				\quad \text{ if } \frac{x}{t} \geq v_R + a_R \\
			\end{cases}
		\end{align}
		
	\item \textbf{ Vacuum is being generated }
	
		In certain cases, with both the left and the right state being
		non-vacuum states, vacuum can be generated in regions of the solution.
		Just think what might happen if the left state has high velocity
		towards the left, and the right state having a high velocity towards
		the right, leaving the center region empty. The result is that we have a
		vacuum state emerging around the center, bounded by two vacuum fronts
		$S_{\mathrm{vac}, L}$ on the left side and $S_{\mathrm{vac}, R}$ on the
		right side.

		The full solution is
		\begin{align}
		\mathbf{W} =
			\begin{cases}
			\mathbf{W}_{L, \text{ with vacuum }} &
				\quad \text{ if } \frac{x}{t} \leq S_{\mathrm{vac}, L}\\
			\mathbf{W}_{vac} &
				\quad \text{ if }
					S_{vac, L} < \frac{x}{t} <  S_{\mathrm{vac}, R}\\
			\mathbf{W}_{R, \text{ with vacuum }} &
				\quad \text{ if } \frac{x}{t} \geq S_{vac, R} \\
			\end{cases}
		\end{align}
		
		
		When do we have a vacuum generating condition? Well,
		$S_{\mathrm{vac}, L} \leq S_{\mathrm{vac}, R}$ must hold, hence
		\begin{align}
		\Delta v_{crit} \equiv
			\frac{2 a_L}{\gamma - 1 } + \frac{2 a_R}{\gamma - 1 }
			\leq v_R - v_L
		\label{eq:vacuum-generating-condition}
		\end{align}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sampling the Solution}\label{chap:sampling-solution}
%====================================================================

With the solvers readily available, the final task is to sample the solution at
some given point $(x, t)$. Assuming we have computed all the star region state
variables, what is left to do is to determine in which case the point $(x, t)$
is located. The flow chart of decision making and finally which relations to
use is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sampling-solution}.


\begin{sidewaysfigure}

equations at a given point $(x, t)$.
\label{fig:sampling-solution}
	}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

Initially, all we need to compute is the star states, then we sample the
solution at the given point that we're interested in, and the flowchart will
tell us which states we need to compute using which relations.
